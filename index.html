                Thanks for your interest, here
                is a quick story of me and this
                website.<br><br>
                MD. Rajaul Ansari The British College alumnus. 
                I loves to solve programming problems
                in most efficient ways. Apart from
                College, I was worked with
                Anamol D & Co. as a software
                developer.
                <br><br>
                I do my work mainly in C-Language,
                C++ and JAVA. C++ and Data Structure
                & Algorithm are my stronger section.
                Besides these I know Web Development,
                LINUX and database as well.
                <br><br>
                This website is basically one of my
                Web Development project which is
                built using HTML and little bit of css.
                Here one can also find ideas for
                projects in different languages.
                <br><br>
